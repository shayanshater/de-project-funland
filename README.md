# Data Engineering Funland Team Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a data engineering pipeline designed to simulate an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution. The system ingests data from an operational database, sanitize and transforms the data into a star-schema data warehouse, and provides visualizations for business intelligence purposes.

The project is built on AWS cloud services, leverages infrastructure-as-code, incorporates best practices in cloud monitoring, error logging, security, and aims to demonstrate a production-like, resilient data platform.

## Objectives

    *   Follow clean code principles: structured repository layout, consistent file naming conventions, modular design, and PEP8-compliant codebase.
    *   Apply Agile development methodology, use project management tools such as Trello and Slack.
    *   Implement Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions and Makefiles to automate testing, security and deployment processes.
    *   Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure reliable and maintainable code with test coverage.
    *   Provision infrastructure using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with Terraform to enable repeatable, version-controlled cloud resource deployment.
    *   Develop data pipelines to extract data from a PostgreSQL relational database and ingest it into AWS S3-based data lakes.
    *   Sanitize, transform, and remodel ingested data into a star-schema data warehouse model using pandas and awswrangler.
    *   Load transformed data into an AWS-hosted data warehouse (e.g. Redshift or PostgreSQL warehouse).
    *   Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and centralized logging via AWS CloudWatch and SNS to ensure pipeline observability.
    *   Build visualizations and business intelligence dashboards using Tableau for business reporting and insights.
